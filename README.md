# THT - Tor Hunting Tools

This is the repo of THT Maltego Transform.
Renamed this from *OSMT* to *THT* because now this runs on our written tools.

It fetches: open ports, banners, emails, btc addresses, linked onions domains and other (soon).

The infos are stored in a database, so that you can do a reverse search (e.g. email address -> domanis).

You'll add the transform with a link, at the time of writing this link is private and released to a small group of people for testing purpose. It'll be released to the public as soon as a stable version will be released.

For every request don't hesitate to contact me (pielco11).
