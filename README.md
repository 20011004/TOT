OnionScan Maltego Transform

This project aim to handle the `json` report from [Onionscan](https://github.com/s-rah/onionscan) to [Maltego](https://www.paterva.com/web7/buy/maltego-clients/maltego-ce.php) with a transform.

## 0x00
What you need is:
* Go 1.6 or 1.7
* Onionscan and its dependencies
* Maltego (tested on CE)

## 0x01
I suggest you to install every entities available in Maltego (free ones), now as now you don't need them all, but the project is just at the beginning. Remember to run `. setVar.sh` to set the right env var before you compile the package.
