Before using the db you need to create it.
1. Make sure you have access to a dbms like MySQL (you need a username and a password, ask to the dbms's admin).
2. Access the dbms with "mysql -u <username> -p" and insert the password when asked.
3. Type "source /path/where/you/saved/dbcreation.sql" where dbcreation.sql is the file in this directory. This will create the db structure.
4. Now you're ready to fill it with informations, have fun ;)
